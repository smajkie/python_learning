'''Exercise 1.3
Write a function (run_timing) that asks how long it took for you to run 10 km. The function continues
to ask how long (in minutes) it took for additional runs, until the user presses Enter. At that point,
the function exits--but only after calculating and displaying the average time that the 10 km runs took.
